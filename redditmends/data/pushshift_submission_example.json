            "selftext": "Hi BIFL,\n\nI'm searching for a warm blanket &amp; flannel sheets to make it through these lovely New England winters. \n\nI'd prefer to find a super thick 100% wool blanket, but I don't know if these are really made anymore. I've tried a Pendleton eco-wise wool blanket, but it's quite thin and not very warm compared to older wool blankets (vintage Golden Dawn) that I've used in the past. I called Pendleton to ask if the National Park blankets would be more appropriate and I was told that they are comparable in thickness / warmth to the eco-wise. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on the warmth and thickness of HBC &amp; Faribault mills blankets, or know of other alternatives? I'm open to ideas, but I'm not interested in an electric blanket. \n\nSimilarly, anybody have experience with LL Bean's flannel sheets or have another brand that they would recommend for non-pilling flannel sheets?\n\nThanks BIFL - stay cozy!",
